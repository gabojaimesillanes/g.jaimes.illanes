  <strong>Equipment:</strong> 0.4 PlaneWave & QHY CMOS - Las Cumbres Observatory

  <br><br><strong>Description:</strong>
  <p><em>"M16, known as the Eagle Nebula, is a vast cloud of gas (mainly hydrogen) and dust located in the constellation Serpens, specifically in the region of Serpens Cauda (the tail of the Serpent), approximately 7,000 light-years away. Its diameter is estimated to be between 70 and 80 light-years. Additionally, it has an associated open cluster."</em></p>

  <br><br><strong>Description:</strong>
  <p><em>"The first scientific images of 2024sbx, a Type II Supernova, were obtained by the Bolivian Virtual Observatory. Three images taken through Sloan photometric filters (r, g, i) are shown, along with a fourth from the DSS catalog. In the center, the Supernova is observed with an increase in brightness, and above it, its associated galaxy."</em></p>
