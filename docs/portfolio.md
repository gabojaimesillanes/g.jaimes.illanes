# Portfolio and Curriculum Vitae

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### 2025-03 – Present

**Momentum Researcher**
Centro de Astrobiología (CAB) – Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) – Instituto Nacional de Técnica Aeroespacial (INTA), Madrid, Spain.
Currently working on the project **Artificial Intelligence Integral Tool for AstroChemical Analysis (AI-ITACA)**. This initiative integrates various Machine Learning (ML) techniques to address key challenges in modern astrochemistry. The aim is to develop a comprehensive AI-based analytical platform that can revolutionize our understanding of chemical complexity in the interstellar medium (ISM) and its connection to the origins of life. The tool leverages extensive archives from the **Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)** and the **James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)**, employing deep learning to identify molecular features and predict unknown chemical pathways in astronomical observations.

### 2024-05 – 2024-09

**JAE Intro ICU Researcher**
Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía (IAA), Granada, Spain.
Development of an ML-based framework for classification of **HI spectral profiles** using **unsupervised clustering** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**. By converting HI data into 2D spectral images, this approach improves detection of profile asymmetries and fine structures, enabling more accurate scientific interpretations. The pipeline is designed for scalability and application to extensive surveys such as those from **Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO)** and its precursors.

### 2021-03 – 2022-09
