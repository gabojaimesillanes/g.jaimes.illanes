## Project Mission

Astro3DBol aims to develop educational 3D models for use in introductory astronomy classes, focusing on archaeoastronomy in the context of the Tiwanakotan culture of Bolivia.

The main goals of the project are:

- To create **free educational kits** for teachers, students, and enthusiasts of astronomy and pre-Incan cultures.
- To strengthen interdisciplinary learning through **workshops, visual guides, and tactile models**.
- To involve students and professionals in the design and fabrication of 3D models.

> The project is supported by FundaciÃ³n FESA, the Office of Astronomy for Development (IAU-OAD), and NAEC Bolivia.
